Pandya picked up the wicket of Klaasen in the 17th over, Bumrah dismissed Marco Jansen in the 18th over, and Pandya dismissed David Miller, the last recognized batsman, off the first ball of the final over. The tail end batsmen were unable to overhaul India's total, and South Africa ended their innings on 169/8, losing by 7 runs.\n\nThis victory marked India's first ICC title since the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, their first world cup title since the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and their second T20 World Cup crown (the first being the 2007 title).
