Prior to the tournament, the ICC announced the eight seeded teams for the Super 8 stage based on T20I rankings. On advancing from the group stage, they were placed in pre-determined positions in the Super 8 stage, irrespective of their position in the group stage. If an unseeded team qualified at the expense of a seeded team, it took the position of the corresponding seeded team that failed to qualify from the group.\n\nSchedule\nOn 28 July 2023, ICC announced that the tournament will be played from 4 to 30 June 2024. The revised schedule was announced on 5 January 2024, with the tournament scheduled to take place from 1 to 29 June. The teams would play 55 matches with three cities in the United States hosting 12 matches and the rest of the matches hosted by six venues in the Caribbean. On 16 May 2024, ICC announced that warm-up fixtures will be held from 27 May to 1 June.\n\nPrize money\nThe ICC allocated a pool of US$11.25 million in prize money for the tournament. The winners will earn at least $2.45 million, the highest prize money in the history of the tournament. In addition, each team will receive an additional $31,154 for each match they win excluding the semi-finals and final.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The tournament, now being held every two years, was first played in 2007 in South Africa. The last tournament held in 2022 in Australia was contested by 16 teams. The defending champions were England, who defeated Pakistan in the final of the previous edition.\n\nHost selection\nIn November 2021, the ICC announced that the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup would be played in the United States and the West Indies. A joint bid was submitted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations.\n\nUSA Cricket's co-hosting was part of efforts to help develop and promote cricket in the United States, where the sport's fanbase is primarily made up of South Asian Americans. Prior to this World Cup, the United States had occasionally hosted West Indies home matches at Central Broward Park in Florida, while a T20 franchise league known as Major League Cricket launched in 2023.\n\nAlthough cricket had never become mainstream in the country, the United States is associated with several notable developments in the early history of the game, including having hosted Canada in the first international cricket match, and American cricketer Bart King having been credited\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Prior to the tournament, the ICC announced the eight seeded teams for the Super 8 stage based on T20I rankings. On advancing from the group stage, they were placed in pre-determined positions in the Super 8 stage, irrespective of their position in the group stage. If an unseeded team qualified at the expense of a seeded team, it took the position of the corresponding seeded team that failed to qualify from the group.\n\nSchedule\nOn 28 July 2023, ICC announced that the tournament will be played from 4 to 30 June 2024. The revised schedule was announced on 5 January 2024, with the tournament scheduled to take place from 1 to 29 June. The teams would play 55 matches with three cities in the United States hosting 12 matches and the rest of the matches hosted by six venues in the Caribbean. On 16 May 2024, ICC announced that warm-up fixtures will be held from 27 May to 1 June.\n\nPrize money\nThe ICC allocated a pool of US$11.25 million in prize money for the tournament. The winners will earn at least $2.45 million, the highest prize money in the history of the tournament. In addition, each team will receive an additional $31,154 for each match they win excluding the semi-finals and final.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Pandya picked up the wicket of Klaasen in the 17th over, Bumrah dismissed Marco Jansen in the 18th over, and Pandya dismissed David Miller, the last recognized batsman, off the first ball of the final over. The tail end batsmen were unable to overhaul India's total, and South Africa ended their innings on 169/8, losing by 7 runs.\n\nThis victory marked India's first ICC title since the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, their first world cup title since the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and their second T20 World Cup crown (the first being the 2007 title). Kohli's knock earned him the Player of the Match award, while Jasprit Bumrah received the Player of the Tournament award. Kohli, Sharma and Jadeja announced their retirement from T20 international format after the final.

Grenada, Jamaica, and Saint Kitts and Nevis did not submit bids to host the World Cup, with Jamaican sports minister Olivia Grange ruling out a bid on cost grounds. In November 2023, it was announced that Trinidad's Queen's Park Oval, the country's most considerable cricket ground, would not be hosting any World Cup matches and that fixtures would be moved to the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in San Fernando. Nigel Camacho, the president of the Queen's Park Cricket Club, stated that the venue would instead most likely host warm-up matches before the start of the main tournament. The Government of Dominica decided to withdraw its venue, Windsor Park, from hosting any matches of the World Cup citing its inability to complete the infrastructural development of the venue before the tournament commences.\n\nIn December 2023, a delegation of representatives from the ICC undertook an inspection of the confirmed host venues in the Caribbean and the United States, so as to finalize the fixtures for the tournament.

On advancing from the group stage, they were placed in pre-determined positions in the Super 8 stage, irrespective of their position in the group stage. If an unseeded team qualified at the expense of a seeded team, it took the position of the corresponding seeded team that failed to qualify from the group.\n\nSchedule\nOn 28 July 2023, ICC announced that the tournament will be played from 4 to 30 June 2024. The revised schedule was announced on 5 January 2024, with the tournament scheduled to take place from 1 to 29 June. The teams would play 55 matches with three cities in the United States hosting 12 matches and the rest of the matches hosted by six venues in the Caribbean. On 16 May 2024, ICC announced that warm-up fixtures will be held from 27 May to 1 June.\n\nPrize money\nThe ICC allocated a pool of US$11.25 million in prize money for the tournament.

At this point, South Africa required 30 runs in 30 balls with six wickets in hand. However, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, and Hardik Pandya bowled economically in the last 5 overs. Pandya picked up the wicket of Klaasen in the 17th over, Bumrah dismissed Marco Jansen in the 18th over, and Pandya dismissed David Miller, the last recognized batsman, off the first ball of the final over. The tail end batsmen were unable to overhaul India's total, and South Africa ended their innings on 169/8, losing by 7 runs.\n\nThis victory marked India's first ICC title since the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, their first world cup title since the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and their second T20 World Cup crown (the first being the 2007 title). Kohli's knock earned him the Player of the Match award, while Jasprit Bumrah received the Player of the Tournament award. Kohli, Sharma and Jadeja announced their retirement from T20 international format after the final.

At this point, South Africa required 30 runs in 30 balls with six wickets in hand. However, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, and Hardik Pandya bowled economically in the last 5 overs. Pandya picked up the wicket of Klaasen in the 17th over, Bumrah dismissed Marco J\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The tournament, now being held every two years, was first played in 2007 in South Africa. The last tournament held in 2022 in Australia was contested by 16 teams. The defending champions were England, who defeated Pakistan in the final of the previous edition.\n\nHost selection\nIn November 2021, the ICC announced that the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup would be played in the United States and the West Indies. A joint bid was submitted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations.\n\nUSA Cricket's co-hosting was part of efforts to help develop and promote cricket in the United States, where the sport's fanbase is primarily made up of South Asian Americans. Prior to this World Cup, the United States had occasionally hosted West Indies home matches at Central Broward Park in Florida, while a T20 franchise league known as Major League Cricket launched in 2023.\n\nAlthough cricket had never become mainstream in the country, the United States is associated with several notable developments in the early history of the game, including having hosted Canada in the first international cricket match, and American cricketer Bart King having been credited\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Grenada, Jamaica, and Saint Kitts and Nevis did not submit bids to host the World Cup, with Jamaican sports minister Olivia Grange ruling out a bid on cost grounds. In November 2023, it was announced that Trinidad's Queen's Park Oval, the country's most considerable cricket ground, would not be hosting any World Cup matches and that fixtures would be moved to the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in San Fernando. Nigel Camacho, the president of the Queen's Park Cricket Club, stated that the venue would instead most likely host warm-up matches before the start of the main tournament. The Government of Dominica decided to withdraw its venue, Windsor Park, from hosting any matches of the World Cup citing its inability to complete the infrastructural development of the venue before the tournament commences.\n\nIn December 2023, a delegation of representatives from the ICC undertook an inspection of the confirmed host venues in the Caribbean and the United States, so as to finalize the fixtures for the tournament.

In November 2023, it was announced that Trinidad's Queen's Park Oval, the country's most considerable cricket ground, would not be hosting any World Cup matches and that fixtures would be moved to the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in San Fernando.

The tournament, now being held every two years, was first played in 2007 in South Africa. The last tournament held in 2022 in Australia was contested by 16 teams. The defending champions were England, who defeated Pakistan in the final of the previous edition.\n\nHost selection\nIn November 2021, the ICC announced that the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup would be played in the United States and the West Indies. A joint bid was submitted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations.\n\nUSA Cricket's co-hosting was part of efforts to help develop and promote cricket in the United States, where the sport's fanbase is primarily made up of South Asian Americans. Prior to this World Cup, the United States had occasionally hosted West Indies home matches at Central Broward Park in Florida, while a T20 franchise league known as Major League Cricket launched in 2023.\n\nAlthough cricket had never become mainstream in the country, the United States is associated with several notable developments in the early history of the game, including having hosted Canada in the first international cricket match, and American cricketer Bart King having been credited\n######################\nOutput:"}}
